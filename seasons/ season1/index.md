## 🧠 Overview

**The Curse of the Crown** is where the journey begins.  
Two nations on opposite ends of Africa, tied together by a single colonial sorcery — **divide, dominate, and disappear.**

- In **Kenya**, settlers seized land with the ink of false treaties.  
- In **Nigeria**, borders were drawn to merge oil with fire — and call it a country.

The British didn’t just conquer land.  
They rearranged identities, manipulated tribes, and handed over power to **the most loyal — not the most capable**.
