## 🧠 Overview

Before apartheid was law, it was a **colonial rehearsal**.  
**The British Empire** engineered the racial hierarchies, pass laws, and spatial segregation that South Africa would later **institutionalize**.

This season reveals the **blueprints of apartheid** — not as a nationalist tragedy, but as **a colonial legacy wrapped in bureaucracy**.

🪪 **Theme:** Surveillance & Spatial Control
