## 🧠 Overview

This season begins in **Ghana**, the former Gold Coast — where entire kingdoms were hollowed for foreign profit.  
But beneath those ruins lies a **pan-African curse** — of **wealth turned into weapon**, of **resources turned into ruin**.

At the season’s midpoint, the camera shifts to **Nigeria**, where oil, tin, gold, and uranium turned the country into **a resource-rich battleground** — and its people into collateral.
