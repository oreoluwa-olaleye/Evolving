## 🧠 Overview

The British Empire branded **Australia and New Zealand** as “terra nullius” — land belonging to no one.  
But this fiction **justified theft**, **murder**, and **cultural annihilation**.

From **Aboriginal Dreamtime** to **Māori war chants**, this season reclaims what was nearly lost to silence.

## 📺 Episode Guide

### 🎬 Episode 1 — “The Terra Nullius Lie”

### 🎬 Episode 5 — “The Wars They Don’t Teach”
