## 🧠 Overview

From the temples of Burma to the harbors of Hong Kong, the British Empire saw Asia as both **a market and a map to redraw**.  
They didn't arrive as guests. They arrived as merchants, missionaries — and masters.

In this season, *Evolving* examines:
- How **British corporate colonialism** thrived through the **East India Company**  
- The **strategic seizures** of Asian territories  
- And the **resistance stories erased by trade treaties**
