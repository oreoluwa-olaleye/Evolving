## 🧠 Overview

Across Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific — British colonial powers enforced a single doctrine:  
**Civilize through classrooms. Obey through English. Forget through scripture.**

Mission schools weren’t just schools.  
They were soft prisons — where children were renamed, beaten for speaking native tongues, and taught to see their own culture as savage.
